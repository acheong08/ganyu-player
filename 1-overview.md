Proposed application: A scriptable, developer-focused music player automating personalized music management.

The app streamlines fragmented workflows (e.g., manual YouTube/CLI downloads, rsync transfers to players like VLC) by integrating spotify-dl/yt-dlp for playlist imports, Invidious for artist subscriptions/auto-downloads, and a Luau scripting engine for plugins. Users write/share scripts (e.g., custom sorting, "Spotify Wrapped"-style reports) via a repository, bypassing reliance on stagnant platforms—addressing long-standing gaps like VLC’s decade-old sorting feature requests.

Why build this? Developers and power users lack tools that balance automation with deep customization. Existing players either restrict workflows (e.g., no CLI integration) or lack extensibility, forcing users to tolerate missing features or maintain brittle DIY setups. This app solves both: scripting enables tailored functionality (e.g., auto-organize by release date, sync with niche cloud services) without forking the core app, while backend integrations unify music discovery, download, and playback.

Value: It replaces patchwork tools with a programmable, all-in-one solution for users prioritizing control over their music libraries. The plugin ecosystem fosters community-driven innovation, ensuring adaptability to evolving needs—a necessity for audiophiles, hobbyists, and developers seeking efficiency without sacrificing personalization.
